    <h2 id="1.1"> 1.1 - The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h2>
    <p>
        In modern business, IT and technology can deliver a 24/7 service to the customer 
        at a time that suits them. 
        For example, a commerce-based business can 
        sell their products on a website without the need for a shop,
        thus cutting overheads for the business. 
        Using social media to promote the business,
        for example Instagram and Facebook can increase its popularity and customers. 
        Therefore, leading to more sales and profits for the <a href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380" style="color: rgb(240, 110, 63)" target="_blank"> Business.</a>
        Quality video and photography content and celebrity endorsements on social media, 
        will also lead to growth within the market.
        Customers will be attracted to these and be more likely to use a product 
        if the online marketing campaign is <a href="https://irokox.com/budgeting-for-promoting-your-product-on-instagram" style="color: rgb(240, 110, 63)" target="_blank"> strong.</a>

    <h2 id="1.2">1.2 - Completing Digital Projects Successfully</h2>
    <p>
        Quality software can successfully deliver digital projects. 
        VS code software for example can allow for effective coding of an app or website. 
        Testing can be undertook to discover problems before the project goes live, 
        this can reduce costs and time that users cannot use the app or website. 
        A good development team, can improve the chances to successfully deliver digital projects. 
        Each team member can bring different skills and expertise in different areas to share 
        the workload to complete the project on time and within budget. 
        Understanding coding languages such as Python, Java Script and HTML, 
        developers can asses which language fits the brief and implement the correct 
        method to successfully complete the <a href="https://activecollab.com/project-management-guides/managing-digital-projects-ebook" style="color: rgb(240, 110, 63)" target="_blank"> project.</a>

    <h2 id="1.3">1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h2>
    <p>
        Planning for digital content such as websites, can be undertaken with trello 
        and flowcharts. These methods can break down projects into smaller tasks 
        and steps that need to be taken in order to deliver the website on time. 
        Specific coding tasks can be placed in sections “To do”, “Doing”, “Done” and 
        labelled with a colour, using the traffic light system. Once a task is 
        completed it can be moved and given a new colour e.g green for completed. 
        This type of planning called Kanban and this is form of planning, 
        can aid time management. Good time management and effective planning, 
        by using Trello will guide the project once the coding stage is underway.<br>

    <h2 id="1.4">1.4 - Rrisks that might impact digital projects</h2>
    <p>
        Digital projects can fail for a number of reasons. 
        Technical problems such as data losses from work that 
        was not backed up if a computer crashes. 
        This can be avoided if project work is stored 
        on multiple platforms such as cloud-based systems 
        like Dropbox. Software that is up to date will 
        also assist in avoiding <a href="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care" style="color: rgb(240, 110, 63)" target="_blank"> technical</a>
        problems for example if working collaboratively, transferring files 
        between computers could become an issue if different 
        versions of software are being used. Another risk 
        to digital projects could be human error. 
        Spelling mistakes that are caused by human error 
        during the coding process, appear unprofessional 
        to the user and they can slow down the publication 
        of the website to correct the spellings and therefore missing a deadline.

        briefs and projects is an important factor in delivering projects 
        on time and within budget. For example, selecting Slack and Trello 
        in the planning process will allow for mobile, app and ‘on the go workflows. 
        This feature could be especially helpful when generating ideas away 
        from a laptop and noting down ideas on a phone or tablet. 
        When working collaboratively selecting a cloud-based storage system 
        can aid workflow and allow for team members to access files in real 
        time and make changes with other team members when working remotely.

    <h2 id="1.6">1.6 - Provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        Uses of Trello as chosen technologies can help achieve outcomes on the website project. 
        As disused before the ability to manage time effectively and progress 
        carefully and methodically through each task and outcome. 
        Adding a label of ‘Not Doing Anymore’ helps to adapt the outcomes 
        as the project progress, too mee the deadline or if plans have changed. 
        Choosing Slack also helped to achieve outcomes. 
        Slack allows for good team work and collaboration with sharing 
        code or error checking.

    <h2 id="1.7">1.7 - legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
    <p>
        GDPR – General Data Protection Regulation created on the 14th April 2016 
        and implemented on 25th May 2018. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation" style="color: rgb(240, 110, 63)" target="_blank"> Reference.</a>
        GDPR is regulation in EU law with the aim to give individuals control of personal data. 
        Controllers of the data, such as digital business and commerce must put in place 
        systems to safeguard, store and process sensitive personal data. 
        These guidelines and constraints are in place to stop data being 
        leaked or hacked by rouge parties, for example bank account numbers. 
        Systems that digital projects can implement could be encryption, 
        that uses algorithms and keys to secure data. These data protection systems can be breached, 
        if they are not kept up to date and security tested often.

    <h2 id="2.1">2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>
    <p>
        IT tools were implemented in making the website. 
        VS code was used to create the HTML and CSS, 
        which enabled a fast approach to writing and 
        testing code. The auto complete function on 
        VS code that assists the user in completing 
        syntax by suggesting smart completions based 
        on variable types andfunctions. This is a fast 
        way to write code and a good tool to use, 
        without typing everything out and avoids errors 
        before the website goes live. The Kanban method 
        aided the website by managing time effectively 
        and easily being able to see what task(s) needed 
        to be completed and adapting outcomes and tasks 
        as the website develops. To implement Kanban effectively, 
        Trello was used to break down each task for example 
        ‘code navigation bar’, ‘code links to images’. 
        Placing these into sections “to do”, “doing”, “done” and “not doing any more” keeps track of time managment towards the deadline.      
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="para1">
    <h2 id="2.2">2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
    <p>
        Appropriate IT tools are key in the success of any project, 
        selecting the right tools for the website supported the 
        construction of the website. Selecting VS code was an 
        appropriate choice for a number of reasons; it is free to 
        download so reduces costs, easy to update and available on 
        different operating systems. VS code was also selected for 
        its ability integrate multiple coding languages such as HTML and CSS. 
        This capability was appropriate for building this website as 
        it aided in creating a fluid and visually interesting site. 
        For example, without CSS, the website would look very dull and wouldn’t 
        display the information in a pleasing and exciting manner to the viewer. 
        Using Trello was also appropriate selection as without it time management 
        would become an issue and meeting the deadline would be in doubt.

<div class="para1">
    <h2 id="2.3">2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
    <p>
        Assessing the strengths and weakness of the final website 
        a number of points come to mind. Overall, I am mostly happy 
        with the website and its contents. For example, the home page 
        displays a variety of different media that compliments the 
        visual design and layout, hopefully this will make the viewer 
        stay on the page for longer and view all the pages. 
        However, the colour scheme I feel could do with some more 
        refining, as at points the text becomes harder to read as 
        the gradual gradient becomes darker. Next time I would spend 
        more time selecting a colour scheme that works throughout the page. 
        The navigation bar is pleasing on the eye and it is clear for the 
        user which link is selected by with the hover function in CSS. 
        The animation transition on the navigation bar when the page is 
        loaded is also a pleasing addition for the viewer and further 
        creates a visually interesting environment. The code for this was 
        researched through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" style="color: rgb(240, 110, 63)" target="_blank">W3schools</a>
        and implemented carefully. 
        Next time I would create animations and transitions for other parts of the page, 
        this would create more of a fluid design throughout.

<br>
<div class="para1">
    <h2 id="2.4">2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <p>
        Further improvements could be implementing the 
        CSS Flexbox function better, as once the page browser 
        is resized or viewed on a mobile device. Some of elements 
        don’t fall into columns once resized and appears unprofessional at times. 
        Another improvement could be to develop some more scrolling 
        behaviour elements for example; scrolling left to more content 
        on the home page or stopping the scrolling down on the home page 
        once the content finished. With a longer deadline these improvements 
        could have been implemented.

    <h2 id="2.5">2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The outcomes of the website and final project are fit for purpose 
        as the website shows all the outcomes displayed in an effective and 
        pleasing manor to the viewer. The links at the top of the page make it 
        easy for the viewer to access each outcome in a quick and easy manner. 
        The website and game created, implement a wide range of coding skills 
        that demonstrate all the new skills developed and learnt on the course. 
        Further code was researched and developed outside course hours that 
        enabled for more advanced processes that could be implemented 
        such as the animation transition on the navigation bar.

    <h2 id="3.1">3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
    <p>
        In terms of IT tools and productivity, the tools and systems 
        largely worked well. However increasing productivity effectively 
        using IT tools and systems, could have been improved by using Trello more 
        effectively by breaking down tasks even further. This would have avoided 
        a last-minute rush to meet the deadline, ensuring that no tasks were forgotten 
        about. One other way of increasing productivity could have been to deliver 
        the website project in teams, where the workload could have been shared. 
        However, creating the website in teams could have also led to confusion 
        and continuity issues with code and design, if good teamwork wasn’t 
        implemented effectively. 
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="para1">
    <h2 id="3.2">3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
    <p>
        Improving productivity and efficiency could have been improved partly, 
        by working in more of an office or classroom environment. 
        Remote working within your home as was the case with this 
        website project can lead to more distractions, computer issues and 
        internet drop outs. These issues can also be overcome by adopting good 
        self-motivation and work ethic if working remotely. 
        Efficiency can be improved by implementing a good file structure 
        and keeping on top of files. These practises will reduce time fixing errors 
        and sourcing the correct images.

<div class="para1">
    <h2 id="3.3">3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
    <p>
        Developing solutions to improve my own productivity include
        many of the aspects discussed in 3.2. 
        Teamwork by using Slack can improve productivity by 
        keeping teams motivated and helping others out with coding, 
        testing and error checking. This approach will enable a faster 
        turn around and less chance of missing the deadline. 
        Using a cloud-based storage device for storing files would be an approach 
        to improve productivity. This would help, when working on different 
        laptops/computers by not having to wait for files to transfer and Less chance of 
        missing data, thus reducing errors. 
    </p>
</div>    
<br>
<div class="para1">
    <h2 id="3.4">3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2> 
    <p>
        Testing digital solutions can be undertaken using a number of different 
        methods. Third party testing can be undertaken for example, 
        a family or friend could access the website and read it 
        through and give feedback. This approach will bring up errors, 
        bugs and improvements that the website creator might not have picked up. 
        Another approach could be to upload the code to codepen or a similar site 
        for others to review the work. Testing can also be undertaken in beta especially 
        for games. This method involves uploading the game and allowing users to play the game 
        (normally for free) and give feedback and find bugs/errors before the game is on sale.
