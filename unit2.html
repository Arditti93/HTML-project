    <h2 id="1.1"> 1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
    <p>
        The home page of the website has a horizontal layout and the content 
        runs left to right. Box dividers split up the content to make it 
        easer to read and visually interesting for the viewer. 
        Two types of media are also embedded on the home page using HTML. 
        Images of Instagram and Twitter link to social media pages once the viewer 
        clicks on them. Once the viewer hovers the mouse over the 
        Navigation bar, the bar changes to a darker shade to make to clearer 
        to which link the viewer is pressing. The links lead 
        you to the written work for unit 1 and unit 2. 
        Once unit 1 is presses, the viewer is taken to a page containing 
        outcomes 1,2,3. Links at the top of the page will take the viewer 
        straight to each written section for easy reading. If the Unit 2 
        is pressed on the Navigation bar this takes the viewer to a identical 
        page containing the written work for unit 2. Pressing Home on the 
        navigation bar will take the viewer back to home page. The Navigation bar 
        also changes size between the home page and the Unit 1 and Unit 2 page. 
        This effect was implemented to avoid blank space on these pages to make 
        them more pleasing on the eye.

    <h2 id="1.5">1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
    <P>
        Copyright constraints effect websites in a number of ways. 
        When selecting images for a website, it is important to use 
        images that have been created by yourself. For example, 
        if web developers just took images from other sources like 
        shutterstock, without paying or referencing the original creator(s) 
        this would be in breach of the copyright laws. 
        The copyright laws protect the original creators of content and 
        give them rights to control the use or commercial exploitation of 
        there work. If developers breach the copyright laws by using any 
        number of issues can arise. For example, a website could take down 
        or the owners could be taken to court and fined. Other constraints 
        could affect a website could be if displaying inappropriate content 
        this could lead to court action or a fine.

    <h2 id="1.6">1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
    <p>
        It is important take into account when designing and building 
        a website, users with disabilities may face when using websites.
        Issues could be blind, deaf or have motor issues that make it 
        hard to use a mouse (Obviously many more disabilities could cause 
        issues for website users). To overcome these issues, developers 
        can implement functions on websites to aid users with disabilities. 
        For example; a zoom text option that will increase the size of text 
        for blind or partially blind users. Another disability that causes issues, 
        could be users with epilepsy. To overcome this, developers need to be 
        aware of using bright flashing images or GIFâ€™s that might affect users 
        with epilepsy.

    <h2 id="1.7">1.7 - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding appropriate filetypes when building and designing websites, 
        are an important factor consider. Using common filetypes such as MP3 
        for audio or MP4 for video content will avoid users having specialist 
        software or plugins to open or use. MP3 and MP4 are encoded using a 
        lossy compression algorithm that reduces the amount of data that is 
        stored in the file, thus making for smaller file sizes. WAV and RAW video 
        files are encoded using a lossless algorithm which retains all the original 
        data without any data compression, making for larger file sizes. 
        Lossy formats are an appropriate choice for websites as lower files 
        sizes will make for quicker downloading or streaming.
